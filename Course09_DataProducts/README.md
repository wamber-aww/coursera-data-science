# Introduction
This is the ninth course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, **Developing Data Products**. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. 

# Course Description
A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covers the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course will focus on the fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.  
In this class students will learn a variety of core tools for creating data products in R and R Studio in specific. Students will be evaluated via quizzes and a culminating project.

### Week 1: Overview
In this overview module, we'll go over some information and resources to help you get started and succeed in the course.

- [Week 1 quiz](https://wamber-aww.github.io/coursera-data-science/Course09_DataProducts/W1Quiz.html)

### Week 2: R Markdown and Leaflet
During this module, we'll learn how to create R Markdown files and embed R code in an Rmd. We'll also explore Leaflet and use it to create interactive annotated maps.

- [Week 2 quiz](https://wamber-aww.github.io/coursera-data-science/Course09_DataProducts/W2Quiz.html)

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.  
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

### Week 4: Swirl and Course Project
Week 4 is all about the Course Project, producing a Shiny Application and reproducible pitch.

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.
